The map includes
<ul>
  <li>Every obtainable item in the game (except food combinations that's too much work XD)</li>
  <li>A LOT of cool builds</li>
  <li>You can use our world as your base as well since it has everything a base needs</li>
</ul><br>

# How do I add the world?

Start by downloading the zip file called <a href=https://github.com/PlagueBuilds/All-items-map/releases>All items map</a>.
Next step is to navigate to your Core Keeper folder and copy/paste everything into the main Core Keeper folder. That's it believe it or not :D. When you open the game, you will have to scroll to the bottom of your worlds becuse the map will be on your 30th world slot.
