The map includes
<ul>
  <li>Every obtainable item in the game (except food combinations that's too much work XD)</li>
  <li>A LOT of cool builds</li>
  <li>You can use our world as your base as well since it has everything a base needs</li>
</ul><br>

# How do I add the world?

Start by downloading the zip file called <a href=https://github.com/PlagueBuilds/All-items-map/releases>All items map</a>.
Next step is to navigate to your Core Keeper folder and copy/paste everything into the main Core Keeper folder. That's it believe it or not :D. When you open the game, you will have to scroll to the bottom of your worlds becuse the map will be on your 30th world slot.

The map will be regularly updated, and more projects are planned in the future. Thanks for the support, we hope you will enjoy.<br>

# WARNING
In the process of making the map we kinda destroyed a lot of things, and there are still who knows where and who knows how many items in the world that are not deleted yet. As addition to that if you find thousands of some random items in one spot PLEASE report it on our discord server. Those problems occure when spawning in items while you have no inventory slots availbale. It sometimes happend that we added one more 9 to 999 (as a full stack) so the game spawns almost 10k items somewhere random in the world. We are trying to clean the world as much as possible in the meantime.<br>
