AND MUCH MORE !!!

# How do I add the world?

Start by downloading the zip file called <a href=https://github.com/PlagueBuilds/All-items-map/releases>All items map</a>.
Next step is to navigate to your "worlds" folder for Core Keeper.

![worlds folder navigation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/216844866-b6fce9d7-8167-42f7-957b-ad58ab7c96f8.png)

After doing this, open the zip file you downloaded and place "1.world.gzip" in your CK worlds folder.
If you already have a world file that is called "1.world.gzip" you don't need to replace it, instead just raise the file world number to an empty one.

Example:

![File number](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/216845775-30b8d60a-2434-4eba-94db-7d04a869a3b8.png)

In this case you would want to rename our world file to 5.world.gzip because that's the first empty slot.

NOTICE. If you are trying to replace a world and it keeps reverting to an old one, it's because of the backup file, which needs to be deleted in order to fix that issue.<br>

# How do I add mapparts file?<br>

Navigate to your CK files and open maps file<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/218548970-79319580-7490-4101-be1d-8363bb364af1.png)<br>

Open folder "0"<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/218549482-39d19a3c-3ea6-423b-9432-7f6d33b7c5a9.png)<br>

Add the mapparts file to the folder, renaming it same as the world file.<br>
Example:<br> 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/218549960-d14874f1-e488-4072-a949-14f29009f9fe.png)<br>

NOTICE!<br>

If you have more mapparts files then worlds, there shouldn't be an issue if you delete some of them.<br>
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124402987/218550344-525b0dbc-54b2-426b-ac2b-0675d1d63cf4.png)

I have 15 mappart files but i only have 3 worlds, and i never had more then 3 worlds. Not sure why this happens but deleting the spare ones won't make any problems.<br>

The map will be regularly updated, and more projects are planned in the future. Thanks for the support, we hope you will enjoy.<br>

# WARNING
In the process of making the map we kinda destroyed a lot of things, and there are still who knows where and who knows how many items in the world that are not deleted yet. As addition to that if you find thousands of some random items in one spot PLEASE report it on our discord server. Those problems occure when spawning in items while you have no inventory slots availbale. It sometimes happend that we added one more 9 to 999 (as a full stack) so the game spawns almost 10k items somewhere random in the world. We are trying to clean the world as much as possible in the meantime.<br>
